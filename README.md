# 🔹 What is an Operating System (OS)? 🤔

An Operating System is software that acts as a bridge between:

*   Hardware
    
*   Applications
    
*   Users
    

Without an operating system, users cannot interact with hardware directly.

### Real-Life Example

Think of an operating system as a restaurant manager.

*   Customer → User
    
*   Kitchen → Hardware
    
*   Manager → Operating System
    

The manager receives requests from customers and coordinates with the kitchen to fulfill them.

Similarly, an operating system receives instructions from users and communicates with the hardware.

* * *

# 🔹 Why Do We Need an Operating System?

Without an operating system:

❌ Applications cannot run

❌ Hardware cannot be managed

❌ Files cannot be organized

❌ Users cannot interact with the computer

### Responsibilities of an Operating System

*   Memory Management
    
*   Process Management
    
*   File Management
    
*   User Management
    
*   Device Management
    
*   Security
    

* * *

# 🔹 Brief History of Linux 📜

To understand Linux, it's helpful to know where it came from.

### Unix

In the 1970s, Unix became one of the most powerful operating systems.

Many modern operating systems are inspired by Unix.

### Minix

Minix was created as an educational operating system to help students understand operating system concepts.

### Linux Kernel

In 1991, Linus Torvalds developed the Linux Kernel and released it as open-source software.

This allowed developers worldwide to contribute and improve Linux.

### Result

Linux became one of the most successful open-source projects ever created.

## 📘 Introduction

One of the most important concepts in Linux is understanding the file system structure. Unlike Windows, where you see drives like **C:**, **D:**, and **E:**, Linux organizes everything under a single directory tree that starts from the **Root Directory (/)**.

Understanding the Linux folder structure helps DevOps Engineers, Cloud Engineers, System Administrators, and Developers easily navigate servers, troubleshoot issues, manage applications, and configure systems.

In this guide, we'll explore the most important Linux directories in simple language with real-world examples.

* * *

# 🌳 What is the Linux File System?

Linux follows a hierarchical directory structure.

Everything starts from:

```bash
/
```

This is called the **Root Directory**.

Think of it as the parent folder of the entire operating system.

### Real-Life Example

Imagine Google Drive:

📁 My Drive

├── 📁 Documents

├── 📁 Photos

├── 📁 Videos

All folders exist inside "My Drive."

Similarly, in Linux:

```bash
/
```

is the top-most parent directory.

* * *

# 🔹 Understanding the Linux Terminal Prompt

When you open a Linux terminal, you may see something like:

```bash
ubuntu@server:~$
```

Let's break it down:

| Component | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ubuntu | Username |
| server | Hostname |
| ~ | Home Directory |
| $ | Normal User |

### Example

```bash
ubuntu@server:~$
```

means:

*   User = ubuntu
    
*   System Name = server
    
*   Current Location = Home Directory
    

* * *

# 🔹 What is the Tilde (~) Symbol?

The tilde symbol represents the current user's home directory.

Example:

```bash
~
```

For user "ubuntu", it points to:

```bash
/home/ubuntu
```

### Real-Life Example

Think of your home directory as your personal workspace where you store files, projects, and configurations.

* * *

# 🔹 What is Root User?

Linux has a super user called:

```bash
root
```

Root has complete control over the system.

### Example Prompt

```bash
root@server:~#
```

Notice the:

```bash
#
```

symbol.

It indicates administrative privileges.

* * *

# 🔹 Linux File System Overview

Common Linux directories:

```bash
/
├── bin

*   Running Processes
    

* * *

# 🏠 /root Directory

### What is /root?

Home directory of the root user.

Example:

```bash
/root
```

Different from:

```bash
/
```

### Important Note

Many beginners confuse:

```bash
/
```

and

```bash
/root
```

They are not the same.

* * *

# 🔍 What is PATH in Linux?

When you run:

```bash
ls
```

Linux automatically finds the command.

But how?

The answer is:

### PATH Variable

Check it:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

Example output:

```bash
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

Linux searches these directories to find executable commands.

* * *

# 🔹 Why PATH is Important?

Without PATH:

You would need to execute commands like:

```bash
/usr/bin/ls
```

Instead of:

```bash
ls
```

PATH makes command execution simple.

# 📘 Linux User Management, File Management & Vi Editor Guide 🐧

!![Fundamentals of Linux](https://github.com/hritikranjan1/linux-zero-to-hero-devops-guide/blob/main/Linux%20cheatsheet%20for%20users%20and%20developers.png?raw=true)

### Master Linux User Administration, File Operations, SSH Access & Vim Editor Basics for DevOps Engineers 🚀

Linux system administration starts with understanding how users, files, and text editors work. Whether you're a DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, System Administrator, or Developer, these are some of the most important Linux skills you'll use every day.

* * *

# 👥 Understanding User Management in Linux

!![Fundamentals of Linux](https://github.com/hritikranjan1/linux-zero-to-hero-devops-guide/blob/main/Hritik's%20Linux%20user%20management%20guide.png?raw=true)

Linux is a multi-user operating system. Multiple users can access the same system simultaneously while maintaining security and isolation.

User management helps administrators:

✅ Control access to resources  
✅ Improve system security  
✅ Assign permissions efficiently |  
✅ Track user activities  
✅ Manage teams using groups

* * *

# 🔹 Why User Management is Important?

Imagine a company server where hundreds of employees work.

Without user management:

❌ Anyone could access sensitive files  
❌ Security risks would increase  
❌ No accountability for changes

With Linux user management:

✔ Each employee gets their own account ✔ Permissions can be controlled ✔ Activities can be tracked

* * *

# 🔹 Types of Users in Linux

### Root User 👑

The root user has complete control over the Linux system.

Capabilities:

*   Install software
    
*   Delete files
    
*   Manage users
    
*   Change configurations
    
*   Access all directories
    

Example:

```bash
root
```

Be careful while using root privileges because a single mistake can affect the entire system.

* * *

### Regular Users 👨‍💻

Regular users have limited permissions.

Example:

```bash
hritik
john
ubuntu
```

These users can work within their own directories but cannot modify critical system files.

* * *

# 🔹 Creating Users in Linux

Linux provides multiple commands to create users.

* * *

## Using adduser

This is the beginner-friendly approach.

```bash
sudo adduser hritik
```

The system will:

*   Create a user
    
*   Create a home directory
    
*   Ask for password
    
*   Collect optional details
    

Example:

```bash
/home/hritik
```

* * *

## Using useradd

More commonly used in automation scripts.

```bash
sudo useradd hritik
```

Unlike adduser, it does not automatically configure everything.

This command is faster and useful for DevOps automation.

* * *

# 🔹 Setting User Passwords

After creating a user, set a password using:

```bash
sudo passwd hritik
```

Example Output:

```bash
New password:
Retype new password:
```

* * *

# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Understanding Groups in Linux

Groups make permission management easier.

Instead of assigning permissions to every user individually, permissions can be assigned to a group.

Example:

Team:

*   Hritik
    
*   Rahul
    
*   Aman
    

All belong to:

```bash
developers
```

Give permissions once to the group instead of three separate users.

* * *

# 🔹 Creating Groups

```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```

* * *

# 🔹 Adding Users to Groups

```bash
sudo usermod -aG developers hritik
```

Explanation:

*   usermod → Modify user
    
*   \-a → Append
    
*   \-G → Group
    

Now Hritik becomes part of the developers group.

* * *

# 🌐 SSH Access in Linux

SSH (Secure Shell) is used to access remote Linux servers.

Syntax:

```bash
ssh username@server-ip
```

Example:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.10
```

This allows administrators to manage remote servers securely.

* * *

# 🔹 Real DevOps Example

Instead of logging into AWS servers manually:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@ec2-public-ip
```

DevOps engineers use SSH to:

*   Deploy applications
    
*   Restart services
    
*   Troubleshoot issues
    
*   Manage Kubernetes nodes
    

* * *

# 📂 File Management in Linux

```

Go back one level:

```bash
cd ..
```

Go to home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

* * *

# 🔹 Create Directories

```bash
mkdir projects
```

Multiple directories:

```bash
mkdir project1 project2 project3
```

* * *

# 🔹 Remove Directories

Empty directory:

```bash
rmdir project1
```

Delete recursively:

```bash
rm -r project1
```

* * *

# 🔹 Create Files

```bash
touch notes.txt
```

Multiple files:

```bash
touch file1.txt file2.txt
```

* * *

# 🔹 Copy Files

```bash
cp source.txt backup.txt
```

Copy directory:

```bash
cp -r source_folder destination_folder
```

* * *

# 🔹 Move or Rename Files

!![Fundamentals of Linux](https://github.com/hritikranjan1/linux-zero-to-hero-devops-guide/blob/main/Linux%20file%20permissions%20explained%20visually.png?raw=true)

Linux is a multi-user operating system. Multiple users can access the same server, so Linux needs a security mechanism to control who can read, modify, or execute files. This security mechanism is known as **File Permissions**.

Understanding file permissions is one of the most important Linux skills for System Administrators, DevOps Engineers, Cloud Engineers, and Security Professionals.

* * *

# 🤔 Why Do File Permissions Exist?

Imagine a server where multiple developers, administrators, and applications are working together.

Without permissions:

*   Any user could delete important files.
    
*   Anyone could modify application code.
    
*   Sensitive data could be exposed.
    
*   System files could be corrupted.
    

Linux permissions help:

✅ Protect sensitive data

✅ Prevent unauthorized modifications

✅ Improve system security

✅ Enable controlled collaboration among users

* * *

# 🔹 Understanding Linux Permission Structure

Run the following command:

```bash
ls -ltr
```

Example Output:

```bash
-rwxrw-r-- 1 ubuntu devops 1200 Jun 5 app.sh
```

Let's break it down:

```bash
-rwxrw-r--
```

### First Character

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| \- | File |
| d | Directory |
| l | Symbolic Link |

Example:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x
```

The "d" means it is a directory.

* * *

# 🔹 Understanding User, Group and Others

Permissions are divided into three sections:

```bash
rwx rw- r--
```

| Section | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| User (Owner) | File owner |
| Group | Users belonging to same group |
| Others | Everyone else |

* * *

# 🔹 Permission Types

Linux uses three permission types:

| Permission | Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read | r | View content |
| Write | w | Modify content |
| Execute | x | Run file/program |

* * *

# 📖 Read Permission (r)

Read permission allows a user to view file contents.

Example:

```bash
cat file.txt
```

Without read permission:

```bash
Permission denied
```

* * *

# ✏️ Write Permission (w)

Write permission allows modification of a file.

Examples:

```bash
echo "Hello" >> file.txt
```

```bash
nano file.txt
```

Without write permission, users cannot edit the file.

* * *

# 🚀 Execute Permission (x)

Execute permission allows running scripts and programs.

Example:

```bash
./script.sh
```

Without execute permission:

```bash
Permission denied
```

* * *

# 🔹 Permission Breakdown Example

Example:

```bash
-rwxrwxr--
```

Split into:

```bash
rwx | rwx | r--
```

| User | Group | Others |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rwx | rwx | r-- |

Meaning:

*   Owner can read, write, execute.
    
*   Group can read, write, execute.
    
*   Others can only read.
    

* * *

# 🔹 Changing Permissions Using chmod

Linux provides the `chmod` command to modify permissions.

Syntax:

```bash
chmod permissions filename
```

* * *

!![Fundamentals of Linux](https://github.com/hritikranjan1/linux-zero-to-hero-devops-guide/blob/main/Linux%20permissions%20and%20ownership%20guide.png?raw=true)

# ✍️ Method 1: Symbolic (Alphabetical) Permissions

Example:

```bash
chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=r file.txt
```

Explanation:

*   u = User
    
*   g = Group
    
*   o = Others
    

Result:

```bash
User  -> rwx
Group -> rw-
Others -> r--
```

* * *

# 🔢 Method 2: Numeric Permissions (Most Common)

Linux converts permissions into numbers.

| Permission | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Read | 4 |
| Write | 2 |
| Execute | 1 |

Add values together:

| Permission | Value |
| --- | --- |
| rwx | 7 |
| rw- | 6 |
| r-- | 4 |
| r-x | 5 |

* * *

# 🚀 Common chmod Examples

### Full Access

```bash
chmod 777 file.txt
```

```bash
rwx rwx rwx
```

Everyone gets full access.

⚠️ Not recommended in production.

* * *

### Owner Full Access

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

```bash
rwx r-x r-x
```

Common for executable scripts.

* * *

### Private File

```bash
chmod 700 secret.txt
```

```bash
rwx --- ---
```

Only owner can access.

* * *

### Read Only

```bash
chmod 444 file.txt
```

```bash
r-- r-- r--
```

Nobody can modify.

* * *

# 🔹 Understanding chown Command

Permissions control access, but ownership determines who owns a file.

View ownership:

```bash
ls -l
```

Example:

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ubuntu devops file.txt
```

Here:

```bash
ubuntu → Owner
devops → Group
```

* * *

# 🔄 Change File Owner

Syntax:

```bash
sudo chown user filename
```

Example:

```bash
sudo chown hritik file.txt
```

Now "hritik" becomes the owner.

* * *

# 🔄 Change Owner and Group

```bash
sudo chown hritik:devops file.txt
```

Result:

*   Owner = hritik
    
*   Group = devops
    

* * *

# 📂 Directory Permissions Are More Important

A very important Linux concept:

Folder permissions take priority.

Example:

```bash
/home/project/app.txt
```

Even if:

```bash
app.txt = 777
```

But user has no access to:

```bash
/home/project
```

They still cannot open the file.

Why?

Because Linux first checks directory permissions before checking file permissions.

* * *

# 💡 Real-World DevOps Example

Suppose:

```bash
/var/www/html
```

contains a production website.

Permissions:

```bash
Owner  = webadmin
Group  = developers
Others = none
```

Benefits:

✅ Developers can update website files.

✅ Normal users cannot modify code.

✅ Sensitive production data remains protected.

* * *

# 🛠️ Most Common Permission Commands

```bash
ls -l
```

View permissions.

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

Set permissions.

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

Add execute permission.

```bash
chmod -w file.txt
```

Remove write permission.

```bash
chown user file.txt
```

Change owner.

```bash
chown user:group file.txt
```

Change owner and group.

* * *

# 📘 Linux Process Management, Monitoring, Networking & Disk Management 🐧

!![Fundamentals of Linux](https://github.com/hritikranjan1/linux-zero-to-hero-devops-guide/blob/main/Linux%20sysadmin%20mastery%20cheat%20sheet.png?raw=true)


Linux is one of the most widely used operating systems in servers, cloud platforms, DevOps environments, and enterprise infrastructures. To become a successful Linux Administrator or DevOps Engineer, understanding **Process Management**, **Monitoring**, **Networking**, and **Disk Management** is essential.

These concepts help engineers monitor system health, troubleshoot issues, manage applications, and efficiently utilize server resources.

* * *

# 🚀 Understanding Linux Processes

A **Process** is simply a running instance of a program.

Whenever you execute a command, start an application, or run a service, Linux creates a process.

### Examples

*   Opening Chrome creates a process.
    
*   Running a Python script creates a process.
    
*   Starting an Nginx server creates a process.
    
*   Running a Docker container creates multiple processes.
    

Think of a process as a task currently being executed by the operating system.

* * *

# 🔹 Why Process Management is Important?

In production environments:

*   Applications may crash.
    
*   Services may consume excessive CPU.
    
*   Memory leaks can occur.
    
*   Multiple processes compete for resources.
    

Process management helps administrators:

✅ Identify running applications

✅ Troubleshoot performance issues

✅ Stop unwanted processes

✅ Prioritize important services

✅ Maintain server stability

* * *

# 📋 Viewing Running Processes

### Display All Running Processes

```bash
ps aux
```

This command shows:

*   Process ID (PID)
    
*   CPU Usage
    
*   Memory Usage
    
*   User Information
    
*   Running Commands
    

Example:

```bash
USER       PID %CPU %MEM COMMAND
ubuntu    1250  2.0  1.5 nginx
root       856  0.5  0.3 sshd
```

* * *

# 🔍 Finding Specific Processes

Search for a particular process:

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```

Output:

```bash
root 1250 nginx
root 1251 nginx
```

Useful when troubleshooting applications.

* * *

# ❌ Killing Processes

Sometimes applications freeze or consume excessive resources.

Stop a process using:

```bash
kill PID
```

Example:

```bash
kill 1250
```

* * *

# 💥 Force Kill a Process

If the process refuses to stop:

```bash
kill -9 PID
```

Example:

```bash
kill -9 1250
```

⚠️ Use carefully because it immediately terminates the process.

* * *

# ⚡ Process Priority Using Nice & Renice

Linux allows assigning priorities to processes.

Higher priority = More CPU time.

View priority:

```bash
top
```

Change priority:

```bash
renice 10 PID
```

Example:

```bash
renice 10 1250
```

Useful when balancing workloads on busy servers.

* * *

# 🔹 What are Systemd Services?

Many applications run continuously in the background.

Examples:

*   Nginx
    
*   Apache
    
*   Docker
    
*   Jenkins
    
*   Kubernetes Components
    

These are called **Services**.

Linux uses **systemd** to manage services.

* * *

# ⚙️ Common Systemctl Commands

Check service status:

```bash
systemctl status nginx
```

Start service:

```bash
systemctl start nginx
```

Stop service:

```bash
systemctl stop nginx
```

Restart service:

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```

Enable service at boot:

```bash
systemctl enable nginx
```

# 📊 Linux Monitoring

Monitoring means continuously observing system performance and health.

Without monitoring:

*   Servers may run out of memory.
    
*   CPU may reach 100%.
    
*   Applications may become slow.
    
*   Storage may get full.
    

Monitoring helps detect problems before users notice them.

* * *

# 🔹 Real-Time System Monitoring

### Using top

```bash
top
```

Shows:

*   CPU Usage
    
*   Memory Usage
    
*   Running Processes
    
*   System Load
    

Example:

```bash
top
```

Updates automatically every few seconds.

* * *

# 🔹 Using htop

```bash
htop
```

Advantages:

✅ User-friendly interface

✅ Color-coded display

✅ Easier process management

✅ Better visualization

Many administrators prefer htop over top.

* * *

# 💾 Monitoring Memory Usage

Check RAM usage:

```bash
free -h
```

Example Output:

```bash
total   used   free
8Gi     3Gi    5Gi
```

Useful for troubleshooting memory-related issues.

* * *

# 📂 Monitoring Disk Space

Check filesystem usage:

```bash
df -h
```

Example:

```bash
Filesystem      Size Used Avail
/dev/sda1       50G  20G  30G
```

* * *

# 🔍 Find Folder Size

```bash
du -sh folder_name
```

Example:

```bash
du -sh logs
```

Output:

```bash
1.5G logs
```

Helps identify storage-consuming directories.

* * *

# 📈 Monitoring in DevOps

Modern DevOps teams use monitoring tools such as:

### Prometheus

*   Collects metrics
    
*   Stores time-series data
    
*   Generates alerts
    

### Grafana

*   Visualizes metrics
    
*   Creates dashboards
    
*   Supports alerting
    

Together they provide complete observability.

* * *

# 🌐 Linux Networking Basics

!![Fundamentals of Linux](https://github.com/hritikranjan1/linux-zero-to-hero-devops-guide/blob/main/Linux%20system%20administration%20cheat%20sheet.png?raw=true)

Networking is one of the most important skills for DevOps Engineers.

Most production issues involve:

*   Connectivity failures
    
*   DNS problems
    
*   Firewall issues
    
*   Network latency
    

Understanding networking helps troubleshoot these problems quickly.

* * *

# 🔹 Check IP Address

```bash
ip addr
```

or

```bash
ifconfig
```

Displays:

*   IP Address
    
*   Interface Information
    
*   Network Configuration
    

* * *

# 🔹 Test Connectivity

Ping another system:

```bash
ping google.com
```

Example:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

Used to verify network connectivity.

* * *

# 🔹 DNS Troubleshooting

Check DNS resolution:

```bash
nslookup google.com
```

or

```bash
dig google.com
```

Useful for debugging DNS-related issues.

* * *

# 🔹 Check Open Ports

```bash
netstat -tulpn
```

or

```bash
ss -tulpn
```

Shows active network connections and listening ports.

* * *

# 💽 Linux Disk Management

Storage is a critical resource in Linux systems.

Applications, logs, databases, and backups require disk space.

Linux administrators must know how to:

*   Identify disks
    
*   Create filesystems
    
*   Mount storage
    
*   Expand volumes
    

* * *

# 🔹 View Available Disks

```bash
lsblk
```

Example:

```bash
NAME   SIZE TYPE
sda    50G  disk
sdb   100G  disk
```

Displays all block devices attached to the system.

* * *

# 🔹 Create Filesystem

Format a disk:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
```

Creates an ext4 filesystem.

⚠️ Formatting deletes existing data.

* * *

# 🔹 Mount a Disk

Create mount point:

```bash
mkdir /data
```

Mount storage:

```bash
mount /dev/sdb /data
```

Verify:

```bash
df -h
```

* * *

# 🔹 Permanent Mounting

Edit:

```bash
/etc/fstab
```

This ensures storage automatically mounts after reboot.

* * *

# 💡 Real-World DevOps Scenario

Imagine a production Kubernetes node:

*   CPU reaches 95%
    
*   Memory usage is high
    
*   Disk is almost full
    
*   Applications are becoming slow
    

A DevOps Engineer would:

1.  Check running processes using `top`
    
2.  Analyze memory using `free -h`
    
3.  Verify disk usage using `df -h`
    
4.  Identify large directories using `du -sh`
    
5.  Investigate network connectivity using `ping`
    
6.  Restart affected services using `systemctl`
    

This is exactly how Linux fundamentals are used in real-world environments.
